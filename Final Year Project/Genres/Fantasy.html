        <h1>About the Genre</h1>
        <h2>Fantasy and its Subgenres</h2>
        <p>Fantasy is a genre of literature that features magical and supernatural elements that do not exist in the real world.
          Although some writers juxtapose a real-world setting with fantastical elements, many create entirely imaginary universes with their own physical laws and logic and populations of imaginary races and creatures.
          Speculative in nature, fantasy is not tied to reality or scientific fact.</p>
        <p>The subgenres within Fantasy include:
        <ol>
          <li>
            High or epic fantasy. Set in a magical environment that has its own rules and physical laws, this subgenre’s plots and themes have a grand scale and typically center on a single, well-developed hero or a band of heroes, such as Frodo
            Baggins and his cohorts in J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings (1954).
          </li>
          <li>
            Low fantasy. Set in the real world, low fantasy includes unexpected magical elements that shock characters, like the plastic figurines come to life in Lynne Reid Banks’s The Indian in the Cupboard (1980).
          </li>
          <li>
            Magical realism. While similar to low fantasy, magical realism characters accept fantastical elements like levitation and telekinesis as a normal part of their otherwise realistic world, as in Gabriel García Márquez’s classic One Hundred
            Years of Solitude (1967).
          </li>
          <li>
            Sword and sorcery. A subset of high fantasy, it focuses on sword-wielding heroes, such as the titular barbarian in Robert E. Howard’s Conan pulp fiction stories, as well as magic or witchcraft.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dark fantasy. Combining elements of fantasy and horror, its aim is to unnerve and frighten readers, like the gargantuan, otherworldly monsters in H. P. Lovecraft’s universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fables. Using personified animals and the supernatural, fables impart moral lessons, like the stories in Aesop’s Fables and Arabian Nights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fairy tales. Intended for children, these fairy tales and folk tales are typically set in distant magical worlds (with beginnings like “Once upon a time, in a land far, far away…”) where trolls, dragons, witches, and other supernatural
            characters are an accepted truth, as in the Brothers Grimm’s Grimm’s Fairy Tales (1812).
          </li>
          <li>
            Superhero fiction. Unlike stories in which a hero acquires special abilities through scientific means, such as exposure to radiation, these protagonists’ powers are supernatural.
          </li>

        <h2>The Witcher - The Last Wish</h2>
        <p>
          Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir,
          have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless hunter.
          Yet he is no ordinary killer.
          His sole purpose: to destroy the monsters that plague the world.
          But not everything monstrous-looking is evil and not everything fair is good
          . . . and in every fairy tale there is a grain of truth.</p>

        <h2>The Bladed Faith</h2>
        <p>Cyrus was only twelve years old when his gods were slain, his country invaded, and his parents—the king and queen—beheaded in front of him. Held prisoner in the invader's court for years, Cyrus is suddenly given a chance to escape and
          claim his revenge when a mysterious group of revolutionaries comes looking for a figurehead. They need a hero to strike fear into the hearts of the imperial and to inspire and unite the people. They need someone to take up the skull mask
          and swords and to become the legendary "Vagrant" — an unparalleled hero and assassin of otherworldly skill.</p>
